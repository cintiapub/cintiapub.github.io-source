I am a visual designer based in San Francisco Bay Area, CA.

I have 7+ years experience in print and web design, social media, branding and marketing, for both B2C and B2B. I also have 2+ years experience in luxury retail, including: leading, sales growth, visual merchandising, styling, loss prevention, public relations and mood boards.

My projects include campaigns, advertising, institutional communication, infographics, photo retouching and editorials, for clients in various fields such as education, technology, fashion luxury, retail, healthcare and marketing.

I studied Advertising and Marketing in Brazil and got my MBA in Creative Direction for Fashion. I've finished my Certificate Program in Graphic Design at UC Berkeley Extension and now I am interested in web design and UI / UX.

I always get excited when I can share knowledge, inspire and connect ideas to create something unique, and ultimately make the end-user's life better.

When I’m not working, I enjoy hiking through the wonderful California mountains and trails, playing with my hula hoop and, of course, hanging out with my playful dog and my lovely husband.
