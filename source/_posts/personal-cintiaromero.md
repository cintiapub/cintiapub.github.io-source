Cintia Romero is a website to represent my work through my career as a Visual Designer, Web Designer, UX Designer and Fashion Designer. I changed the layout, building a interface to represent my style of work, resulting in a contemporary, responsive and clean website. 

Welcome to my portfolio creative design process. 

<br/>
### The Pain points

##### A) "BORING INTERFACE"

After feedback and statistics in my portfolio website, I noticed I needed a platform with the capacity to properly show my creative work through the interface. The previous version was also clean, responsive and easy to navigate, but it was missing fundamental elements to reinforce the heart of my work, the creative design and the evolution of my path. 

##### B) "A POOR DESCRIPTION OF MY WORK"

The main goal of the website is to display my design work, but the lonely images needed more support to explain more about the projects that I worked for. It was time to go deeper in the contents. 

<br/>
### The Design Solution

To present all my skills in my portfolio, not just pointing out the categories, but imprinting my creative process in every little piece of my website. Now it would be possible to see the UX work that I've done to achieve the webdesign structure, the layout and all the concepts behind the visual. 

Striving for better organized data, a clean interface, responsive layout, and a portfolio which is very easy to navigate, no matter which platform you choose to access cintiaromero.com. 

Finally, the website would show a little bit of myself, my style, my way to work and my preferences. 

A big thank you to the best developer and consultant: [Tiago Garcia](http://tiagorg.com), that helped me out to put all of it together to show the world my Design. It was great working with you in this project.
