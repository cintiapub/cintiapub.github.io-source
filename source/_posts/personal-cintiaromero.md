### The problem definition 

To create a website which represents me and my style, and shows my work in an organized way, being easy to navigate in multiple platforms.  

<br/>
### The User Research

Through interviews and researches with recruiters and design companies, I found the following data: 

1. Most of the recruiters usually go to the candidate's profile using a computer, but also many of them send links to others about the profile, and the receivers of these links might use a mobile device to check the information. About the mobile device users:
  - 63% use a smartphone
  - 37% use a tablet or other platforms
2. It turns out the candidate's Social Profiles are very useful to choose an ideal fit for the position. I found out 69% of the recruiters go through the candidate's social profiles. It's essencial to display the social icons with a clear access to the recruiter.

In order to define an approachable layout, I did some user tests and found the following pain points: 

##### A) Clean, but boring Interface 

After feedbacks and statistics in my previous portfolio, I noticed I needed a platform with the capacity to properly show my creative work through the interface. The previous version was also clean, responsive and easy to navigate, but it was missing fundamental elements to reinforce the heart of my work, the creative design.  

##### B) A poor description of my work  

The main goal of the website is to display my portfolio, but the lonely images needed more support to explain more about the projects I worked for.  

##### C) Confusing organization  

Too much information to group in a few categories.  

<br/>
### The Design Solution

- Improving the UX 
- Better organizing the data, creating sub-categories and recommendations to next pieces
- Clean interface. I chose a minimalist design style, wihch reinforces my style of work (I love minimalist design)
- A responsive layout, easy to navigate in multiple platforms

The website shows a little bit of myself, my preferences and my style of work.  

A big thank you to the best developer and consultant: [Tiago Garcia](http://tiagorg.com), that helped me out to pull all of it together to create my Portfolio.
