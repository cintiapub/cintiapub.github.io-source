I started as a Visual Designer and I have 7+ years experience in the graphic design field, designing mostly for Education and Fashion fields. 

In my projects I developed visual design for printed and online media. I did campaigns, infographics, advertising collections, institutional communication and fashion editorials. I retouched a lot of photography for catalogues, advertised and updated designs for social networks. 

I have experience in Marketing, Printed, Web Design, Social Media and Visual Design. 

Since April 2014, I have been working in Fashion retail, that helped me a lot better understand the consumer behavior and to improve my english and I am grateful for this experience. I am looking for working again with Graphic design. Since I am bi-lingual I can also bridge the work with a Latin America office.
