I started as a Visual Designer in Brazil and I have 7+ years experience with graphic design, designing mostly for Education and Fashion fields. 

In my projects I developed visual designs for print and online media. I did campaigns, infographics, advertising collections, institutional communication and fashion editorials. I retouched a lot of photographs for catalogs, and I also did social media graphic design and marketing.

Since April 2014, I have been working in Fashion retail, which helped me to better understand the local consumer behavior and also to improve my English. I am looking for working again with graphic design. Since I am bi-lingual I can also bridge the work with your Latin America office.
